# RAG-Document-QandA-Chatbot-with-chat-history
This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload PDF documents and interactively query their content using natural language. Built with the LangChain, it utilizes HuggingFaceEmbeddings for text processing, Chroma for vector storage, and Gemma2 as the language model, enabling context-aware responses while maintaining chat history.
